storing notes about what each of the files are here

sim folder stores info that gadget needs to run a simulation.
I'm guessing that initial_conditions stores its namesake, but I can't read the
files so I'm not sure what they are the IC for.
rockstar stores post-sim analysis stuff
gadget-gde has a bunch of stuff...

In the sim folder:

run.sbatch ###################

file that submits the simulation to slurm. Need to change filepaths to my
directory. automatically(?) handles restarting a simulation for some reason

-does the simulation need to stop itself? (i.e. if the power goes out, I will
not get my simulation back, correct?)

lgadget.param ####################

the parameter file for a simulation, storing initial conditions.
